  -  Hi, Iâ€™m @Fa00-creado.
- -I'm a beginner in Python programming, but I'm eager to learn and grow my skills. I'm currently exploring Python through online courses, and I'm looking for opportunities to collaborate on projects and gain real-world experience. If you have any projects suitable for beginners, I'd love to contribute and learn from more experienced developers.
